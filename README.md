# decemedip: Cell type deconvolution of cellâ€‘free DNA via Bayesian hierarchical modeling

The R package `decemedip` is a novel computational paradigm developed for inferring the relative abundances of cell types and tissues from tissue bulk or circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) measure by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-Seq). This paradigm allows using reference data from other technologies such as microarray or WGBS.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `decemedip` in R from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nshen7/decemedip")
```
## Citation

Manuscript is currently under development.
